# Task 1 : Linear regression

**Description:**
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

**Implementation:**

This is a simple linear regression task in which we are required to predict percentage of student result based on number of hours studied.
I have tried different forms of regression apart from simple linear regression that you can find in the notebook.
