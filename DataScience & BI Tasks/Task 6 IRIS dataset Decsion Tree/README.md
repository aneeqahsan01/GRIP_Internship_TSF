# Task 6 : Prediction using Decision Tree

**Description:**
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

**Implementation:**

We are required to train a decision tree classifier on IRIS dataset and visualize the tree graphically in this task. I have done this in the notebook with several other methods as well for classification.
You can check the notebook to see which methods were implemented.
